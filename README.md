# Titanic-Survival-Predictor

This is a Machine Learning model that utilizes Logistic Regression to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of various passenger attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. By analyzing these features, the model can make predictions on whether a passenger would have survived or not. 

In addition to the model, this project also includes a web application that has been deployed on the Heroku platform using Django framework. The web application allows users to interact with the trained model and obtain predictions on the survival probability of a passenger based on inputted information.
